# Jump Start with Python

This is a collection of notes to jump start in data science with Python

```{note}
The notes are a joint effort of the instructor and the students in
STAT 5255, Fall 2021, through experimental learning.
```


These notes are built using Jupyter Book 2.0.  

# I Understand

(From Dr. Nicholas Eubank)
> Data science is an applied discipline, and so this will be an
> intensely applied class with lots of hands-on exercises.
> 
> To make it possible for us to work through problems together as they
> arise, we will dedicate most of our class time to completing these
> exercises in small groups. That means that students will be required
> to read instructional material before every class so they will be
> ready to do these exercises. This is what is referred to as ``flipping
> the classroom."
> 
> In order to make this class organization work, it will be critically
> important that students do their assigned readings before every class,
> and as discussed below, this will be reflected in how grades are
> assigned in this class. Students who do not complete their assigned
> readings and tutorials before each class should not expect to receive
> good grades, regardless of performance on project assignments. 

We will supplement the in-class exercises with topic presentations.
